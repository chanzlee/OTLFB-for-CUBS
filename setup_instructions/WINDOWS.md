# Setup for Running O-TLFB Locally on Windows

## Installation Options

Unfortunately, O-TLFB can't be run directly on Windows. There are two ways to get around this:

1. [Setup a Linux Subsystem](https://www.windowscentral.com/install-windows-subsystem-linux-windows-10) (recommended)
2. [Create a Linux virtual machine](https://www.windowscentral.com/how-run-linux-distros-windows-10-using-hyper-v)

When choosing a Linux distribution, choose either Ubuntu or another Debian distribution. Once you have setup your Linux subsystem or VM, follow the [instructions for Linux](./LINUX.md).
